# Factory Simulation Web Application Master Plan

## **App Overview and Objectives**
This web application is designed for factory managers and adjusters to simulate and monitor machine breakdowns, repair tasks, and the overall performance of machines and adjusters. The goal is to optimize the number of adjusters and monitor machine utilization.

The core functionality revolves around simulating machine breakdowns based on **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)**, assigning adjusters to repair the machines, and tracking both machine and adjuster utilization in real-time.

---

## **Target Audience**
- **Service Managers**: Factory managers who coordinate repair tasks and optimize machine performance by assigning adjusters to broken machines.
- **Adjusters**: Factory workers who perform repairs on the machines and update the system when tasks are completed.

---

## **Core Features and Functionality**
1. **Machine & Adjuster Management**
   - Add and manage different **categories of machines** (lathe, turning, drilling, etc.) with MTTF values.
   - Add **adjusters** with expertise for different machine categories.
   - Manage **machine and adjuster counts**.

2. **Real-Time Simulation**
   - Simulate machine breakdowns based on MTTF values.
   - Dynamically assign adjusters to broken machines using a queue system.
   - Track and display real-time machine and adjuster statuses.

3. **Dashboard & Live Stats**
   - **Live Event Log**: Display real-time breakdowns and repairs.
   - **Charts & Graphs**: Show machine utilization and adjuster workload.
   - **Adjustable Parameters**: Allow the service manager to change the number of machines, adjuster counts, and failure rates during simulations.

4. **User Authentication & Role Management**
   - **Service Manager**: Can manage simulations, assign tasks, and view reports.
   - **Adjuster**: Can view assigned tasks and update repair status.

5. **Exportable Reports**
   - Generate CSV/PDF reports for machine and adjuster utilization.
   - Show historical data of past simulations.

## **High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations**

1. **Frontend**:  
   - **React.js** for building the interactive user interface and dashboard.  
   - **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive styling.  
   - **Recharts** or **Chart.js** for rendering dynamic graphs and charts.

2. **Backend**:  
   - **Spring Boot** for the REST API and backend logic.  
   - **Spring Security** for managing user authentication and role-based access.  
   - **WebSockets (Spring WebSocket)** for real-time updates and communication between the server and the client.  
   - **JPA (Java Persistence API)** for managing database interactions.  
   - **H2 (for development)** or **MongoDB** for production database storage.  
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.

3. **Data Storage**:  
   - **MongoDB** (production) for storing simulation data, machine configurations, and user info.  
   - **Redis** (optional) for caching real-time data for performance optimization.

## **Conceptual Data Model**
1. **Machine**  
   - ID  
   - Category (lathe, turning, drilling, etc.)  
   - MTTF (Mean Time to Failure)  
   - Status (working, broken, being repaired)

2. **Adjuster**  
   - ID  
   - Name  
   - Expertise (list of machine categories they can repair)  
   - Status (idle, repairing)

3. **Simulation**  
   - ID  
   - Date/Time  
   - Number of machines  
   - Number of adjusters  
   - MTTF values  
   - Machine Utilization (percentage)  
   - Adjuster Utilization (percentage)

4. **Event Log**  
   - ID  
   - Type (machine breakdown, repair completion, etc.)  
   - Timestamp  
   - Description

## **User Interface Design Principles**
- **Service Manager Dashboard**:
  - A clean and intuitive layout with a sidebar for quick navigation.
  - **Real-time stats** displayed prominently (machine utilization, adjuster workload).
  - A section to **configure simulation parameters** (number of machines, adjusters, MTTF).
  - **Event log** for viewing live activities and simulation results.

- **Adjuster Dashboard**:
  - A simple, task-focused interface showing assigned machines to repair.
  - **Real-time updates** on repair progress and status.
  - An easy-to-use interface to **mark tasks as completed**.

---

## **Security Considerations**
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication via JSON Web Tokens to ensure that only authorized users (Service Manager and Adjusters) can access the system.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles (Service Manager vs. Adjuster) have restricted access to certain features.
- **Secure WebSockets**: Ensure real-time data communication is encrypted and secure.

## **Development Phases or Milestones**
1. **Phase 1: Initial Setup**  
   - Set up the **Spring Boot backend** with the necessary database (PostgreSQL).  
   - Create **user authentication** and role management.  
   - Implement the basic **machine and adjuster management** functionality.

2. **Phase 2: Simulation Engine**  
   - Develop the **real-time simulation logic** for machine breakdowns and adjuster assignments.  
   - Implement **real-time WebSocket communication** for event tracking.

3. **Phase 3: Frontend Development**  
   - Build the **Service Manager Dashboard** with live stats and simulation controls.  
   - Create the **Adjuster Dashboard** with assigned tasks and repair tracking.

4. **Phase 4: Reporting & Export Features**  
   - Implement **report generation** (CSV/PDF).  
   - Develop **historical data tracking** for comparing simulations.

5. **Phase 5: Final Testing & Deployment**  
   - Perform **end-to-end testing** on the simulation, real-time updates, and reports.  
   - Deploy the application and ensure **scalability** for larger factories.
